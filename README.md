## VNS-PRM* for Physical Orienteering Problem

#### The source codes will be provided after publication of the proposed method. 

This repository will contain solver for the Physical Orienteering Problem based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method combined with the asymptotically optimal sampling-based Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM*).
