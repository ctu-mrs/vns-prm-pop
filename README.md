## VNS-PRM* for Physical Orienteering Problem

#### The source codes will be provided after publication of the proposed method. 

This repository will contain solver for the Physical Orienteering Problem (POP) based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method combined with the asymptotically optimal sampling-based Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM*).

**Repository contains following content:**
- **datasets** folder contains dataset instances of POP
- **results** folder contains computational results shown in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2019.2923949)
- **sources** folder contains source codes for VNS-PRM* solver for POP
